Phoenix: APS, which includes a ton of other stuff. SRP looks rural only (keyholed cities under APS)
Tucson: Tucson Electric Power
Los Angeles: LADWP. Small territory but contained and hopefully consistent. SCE is sprawling.
San Francisco: PG&E is sprawling. No good option that I see.
San Diego: SDG&E
Denver: Xcel, but they cover random other stuff in other states too
Boise: Idaho Power, but they cover smaller towns all down the Snake River too
Billings: NorthWestern Energy, but sprawling territory
Las Vegas: NV Energy serves both Reno and LV, plus random small towns in the western half of the state
Reno: see above
Albuquerque: Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), but they serve most urban load in the state, including Santa Fe and clusters of towns in the SW and S of the state.
Portland: PGE, but misses northern part of city and includes Salem
Eugene: bunch of coops and PUDs, looks messy. Eugene Water & Electric is city center.
Salt Lake City: Rocky Mountain Power aka PacifiCorp. Huge territory spanning most of Utah and Wyoming, part of Eastern Idaho.
Seattle: Seattle City Light. Puget Sound Energy is bigger but spread out
Spokane: Avista, but they cover lots of small cities in Eastern WA and N Idaho. There are a few co-ops too.
Cheyenne: Black Hills Energy (some territory in the middle of CO and Rapid City, SD too)
Calgary: AESO, which breaks out Calgary and Edmonton load specifically (hourly load data here: https://www.aeso.ca/market/market-and-system-reporting/data-requests/hourly-load-by-area-and-region/)
Edmonton: AESO, see above
Vancouver: BC Hydro (hourly load data here: https://www.bchydro.com/energy-in-bc/operations/transmission/transmission-system/balancing-authority-load-data/historical-transmission-data.html)
